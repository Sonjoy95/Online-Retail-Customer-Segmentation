# Online Retail Customer Segmentation
## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing customer segmentation for an online retail dataset using unsupervised machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering. The primary goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their purchasing behavior (Recency, Frequency, Monetary - RFM) to enable more targeted and effective marketing strategies. This project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline from data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature engineering, clustering, and actionable insights.

## Key Features and Steps
1. #### **Data Loading & Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Imported the `OnlineRetail.csv` dataset, handling potential encoding issues.
    - Conducted a thorough initial EDA, including:
      * `df.info()` for data types and non-null counts.
      * `df.describe()` for statistical summaries of numerical features.
      * Missing value analysis.
      * Statistical summaries of categorical features (value_counts()).


2. #### **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:**
    - Dropped rows with missing `CustomerID.`
    - Removed canceled orders (identified by 'C' in `InvoiceNo`).
    - Converted InvoiceDate to datetime objects.
    - Calculated `TotalPrice` (`Quantity * UnitPrice`).
    - Filtered out transactions with non-positive `Quantity` or `UnitPrice` to ensure valid sales data.


3. #### **EDA on Processed Data:**
    - `df.info` to display basic information about datset after preprocessing
    - Visualizations (histograms and box plots) for `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, and `TotalPrice` after log1p transformation to address severe skewness and visualize distributions effectively.
    - Bar plots for top countries by transaction count.


4. #### **RFM Feature Engineering:**
    - Engineered three critical marketing metrics for each customer:
      * **Recency:** Days since last purchase.
      * **Frequency:** Number of unique purchases.
      * **Monetary:** Total spending.
    - Applied outlier treatment to RFM features by capping values at the 5th and 95th percentiles to mitigate the influence of extreme values on clustering.
    - Scaled the RFM features using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features contribute equally to distance calculations in K-Means.


5. #### **Optimal Cluster Determination & K-Means Clustering:**
    - Utilized the Elbow Method (WCSS vs. K) and Silhouette Score (average silhouette score vs. K) to determine the optimal number of clusters.
    - **Chosen K=4** based on a balance between statistical metrics and the desire for richer, more actionable customer segments for marketing purposes.
    - Applied the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into these four distinct groups.


6. #### **Cluster Analysis & Visualization:**
    - Calculated and analyzed the mean RFM values for each cluster to profile their unique characteristics.
    - Visualized the customer segments using:
      * A 2D PCA-reduced scatter plot, clearly showing customer distribution, with cluster centroids marked and a legend displaying descriptive segment names (e.g., "Loyal Big Spenders").
      * Bar plots illustrating the average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each cluster, providing clear visual comparisons.


## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the "Online Retail" dataset, which contains transactional data from a UK-based online retail store.
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayuv/onlineretail)
- **Dataset Features:**
The dataset contains the following columns:
    * `InvoiceNo`: Invoice number. A 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with 'C', it indicates a cancellation.
    * `StockCode`: Product (item) code. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
    * `Description`: Product (item) name.
    * `Quantity`: The quantity of each product per transaction. Negative values indicate returns.
    * `InvoiceDate`: Invoice Date and time. The day and time when each transaction was generated.
    * `UnitPrice`: Unit price. Product price per unit in sterling (Â£).
    * `CustomerID`: Customer number. A 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
    * `Country`: Country name. The name of the country where each customer resides.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.13**
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** For preprocessing (`StandardScaler`, `PCA`) and clustering (`KMeans`).
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For enhanced data visualizations.

## How to Run the Project

To replicate the results or run the code:

**Prerequisites:**
   - Python 3.13 (Ensure that you have python 3.13 version to avoid library or package compatability issue)
   - Pip (Python package installer) (When you create virtual environment or install python, by default it installs pip)

1. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
     ```bash
     python -m venv your_venv_name  # This code will create virtual environment named your_venv_name
     # Activation on Windows (use command prompt or power shell)
     .\your_venv_name\Scripts\activate
     # Activation on macOS/Linux (use terminal)
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sonjoy95/Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation.git
    cd Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Place Data:** Ensure `OnlineRetail.csv` is in the project's root directory or provide the dataset path to pandas `read_csv` in Jupyter Notebook.

7.  **Execute Code:** Run the Python scripts from jupyter notebook sequentially. The script will print various analyses and display several plots.


## Key Findings & Customer Segments
The project identified four distinct customer segments, each with unique RFM characteristics:
 - **Loyal Big Spenders (Cluster 3):** Very recent, highly frequent, and extremely high spending customers. Most valuable segment.
 - **Promising Regular Spenders (Cluster 1):** Relatively recent, good frequency, and high spending customers. Active with growth potential.
 - **Occasional Spending Customers (Cluster 0):** Moderate recency, low frequency, and moderate spending customers. Buy occasionally and need nurturing.
 - **Rarely Spending Customers (Cluster 2):** Very high recency, very low frequency, and lowest spending customers. One-time buyers or inactive/churned.


## Actionable Insights
These segments provide a clear roadmap for targeted marketing:
 - **Loyal Big Spenders:** Focus on retention, exclusive offers, and personalized recommendations.
 - **Promising Regular Spenders:** Encourage increased frequency and average order value through cross-selling and tiered rewards.
 - **Occasional Spending Customers:** Implement targeted promotions and re-engagement campaigns.
 - **Rarely Spending Customers:** Initiate win-back campaigns and feedback surveys to understand inactivity.
